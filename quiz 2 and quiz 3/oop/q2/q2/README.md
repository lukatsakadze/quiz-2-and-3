so this task was really confusing at first but than after looking over and over again it became clear.first list has all the integers , second list has strings. in third list we should get 12 strings which are assigned by what number does integer have.but way it chooses on second list is that it  starts from numeration one and than skips every one string.for example if we have number 1 in first list on first number,than on second list second string will be chosen. on number 2 ,4th string will be chosen and etc. list finishes when all 12 integers are assigned in list 1
